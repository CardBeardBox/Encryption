# Encryption
A simple data string encryption program

1. Takes user input of a data string to encrypt
2. Runs through a for loop to detect each character type
3. Based on character type, send the character to an encryption function (currently simply adding 6 to each numeric value)
4. Converts numeric value back to a symbol/alphabetic value if needed
5. Stores each encrypted character in a list
6. Uses another for loop to go through the list and print out an easier to read format of the encrypted data
