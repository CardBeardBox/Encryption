# Encryption
# A simple data string encryption program

# 1. Takes user input of a data string to encrypt
# 2. Runs through a for loop to detect each character type
# 3. Based on character type, send the character to an encryption function (currently simply adding 139 to each numeric value)
# 4. Stores each encrypted character in a list
# 5. Uses another for loop to go through the list and print out an easier to read format of the encrypted data
